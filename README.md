# formValidatorCancun
A JavaScript form validator for possible telephone numbers in Mexico. Includes all of NA as well as most of Europe.
This is my first attempt at writing regular expressions in JavaScript from scratch.
The parameters fairly pedestrian for 'name', 'date' and 'email and are listed in the comments.
The kicker was the list of possible phone exchanges in Mexico. These are also listed in the comments.
Please advise me of any glitches as well as any improvements I might make to add functionality.
